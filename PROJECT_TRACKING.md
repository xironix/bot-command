# Bot-Command Project Tracking

## Overview
This file tracks the progress of the bot-command project - a covert intelligence-gathering tool designed to silently intercept and replicate data from Telegram-based stealer bots.

## Project Status: IMPLEMENTATION

### Completed
- Project structure definition
- Initial documentation review
- Setting up basic project structure
- Defining core dependencies
- MongoDB setup and indexing
- Worker pool architecture
- Message parsing for different data types
- Async Telegram bot monitoring implementation
- Elasticsearch integration for log storage and correlation
- Main coordinator implementation
- Docker environment setup
- Kibana dashboard templates
- Documentation updates
- Enhanced message parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Media file management with automatic cleanup
- Bot filtering with multiple methods (allowlist, blocklist, patterns)
- Log rotation and management
- Security improvements (environment variables for credentials)
- Implementation of stealer-specific parser plugins architecture
- Parsers for RedLine, Lumma, SnakeStealer, RisePro, StealC, and Vidar families 
- Integration of parser plugins with the main message parser
- Credential value scoring system with domain and username pattern analysis
- Parser performance metrics tracking and reporting
- Detailed debug mode with granular parser diagnostics
- Parser for Azorult stealer family with credit card and FTP credential extraction
- Added flexible regex pattern matching with non-capturing groups and optional elements
- Implemented JSON-first parsing approach for improved accuracy and less brittle parsing
- Added circuit breaker patterns and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Added queue monitoring with backpressure controls to prevent memory issues
- Enhanced file handling with archive extraction (.zip, .tar.gz)
- Added post-parse validation to detect misidentified stealers
- Implemented non-interactive Telegram authentication using environment variables
- Added startup validation for critical environment variables
- Fixed concurrency bugs in shared state (message_parser.stats) using asyncio.Lock

### In Progress
- Integration testing
- Elasticsearch GeoIP pipeline implementation
- Parsers for additional stealer families (Metastealer, RecordBreaker, PredatorTheThief)
- Command-line interface with debug options
- Enhanced correlation between stolen credentials and their sources

### Pending
- Log correlation engine refinement
- Visualization implementation

### Known Issues
- GeoIP enrichment for Elasticsearch requires additional pipeline setup
- CSV parsing could be further improved for more formats
- Needs more comprehensive test suite

## Component Details

### Core Architecture
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Notes:** Implemented asyncio-based event loop with separate worker pools for monitoring, downloads, and database operations. Added circuit breakers and retry logic for improved resilience.

### Database
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Notes:** MongoDB implementation with optimized indexing for credentials, cookies, and system info. Now with circuit breaker protection to handle service unavailability.

### Bot Monitoring
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Notes:** Silent Telegram API monitoring implemented through Telethon library with automated authentication process.

### Processing Pipeline
- **Status:** Implemented
- **Notes:** Worker pool architecture with separate queues for monitoring, downloads, and database operations. Now with health monitoring, backpressure controls, and poison pill detection.

### Analysis Engine
- **Status:** Partially Implemented
- **Notes:** Basic correlation implemented; needs refinement for more complex patterns

### Visualization
- **Status:** Not started
- **Notes:** Will create dashboards for intercepted data using Elasticsearch and Kibana

## Next Steps
1. Complete integration testing with Telegram API
2. Test Docker environment with live data
3. Complete parsers for remaining stealer families
4. Implement GeoIP enrichment pipeline in Elasticsearch
5. Enhance crypto wallet extraction and validation capabilities
6. Test value scoring system on real-world data
7. Refine correlation engine for real-world scenarios
8. Complete advanced Kibana dashboards with parser performance metrics
9. Implement value scoring aggregation to identify high-value targets

## Recent Improvements
- Fixed concurrency bugs in shared state (message_parser.stats) using asyncio.Lock
- Implemented dynamic bot username retrieval using Telegram API instead of relying on hardcoded usernames
